# Battleships Project: JTerm 2015
Simulate Battleship games using artificially intelligent players:

<p><strong>Run Battleships:</strong></p>
```
   battleships -[ship placer (d|c)] [player1 ID] -[ship placer (d|c)] [player2 ID] <br/>
```
   Ex) battleships -d 1 -c 2  Creates game, player[1] with default ship placer vs player[2] with custom ship placer

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>
1) Dumb Player (In Progress)
<ul>
   <li>Places ships and shoots to opponent board in predefined patterns that never change.</li>
</ul>
2) Chance Player (In Progress)
<ul>
   <li>Places ships and shoots to opponent board based on probabilities calculated for each spot on the board.</li>
</ul>
3) Genetic Player (In Progress)
<ul>
   <li>Uses genetic algorithms to develop placing and shooting strategies.</li>
</ul>
